# Personal Docker Experiments - DO NOT CLONE OR FORK

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is a personal playground. Not for external use. ⚠️

This repository contains my personal Docker experiments. It is **NOT** intended for anyone else to use, clone, or fork. The code here may be incomplete, non-functional, or poorly optimized. Its sole purpose is for me to learn and explore Docker's capabilities.

## Repository Purpose

- **Personal Learning**: This is my sandbox for understanding Docker's intricacies.
- **Experimentation**: I use this to test various Docker configurations and setups.
- **Note-taking**: These projects serve as my personal notes on Docker functionality.

## Why You Should Not Use This Repository

1. **Not for Production**: Nothing here is production-ready or even fully functional.
2. **Potentially Broken Code**: Many projects may be incomplete or intentionally misconfigured.
3. **No Support**: I will not provide any support or accept pull requests.
4. **Frequent Changes**: I may drastically alter or delete projects without notice.
5. **Massive Headaches**: Attempting to clone or use this project will likely result in significant frustration and wasted time due to its experimental nature and lack of documentation.

## Final Note

If you've stumbled upon this repository, please understand that it's not meant for you. It's my personal Docker learning journey. Feel free to create your own experiments, but please do not use, clone, or fork this repository.
