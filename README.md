# Docker Experiments

## Overview

This repository is a collection of Docker-based projects aimed at exploring different setups, service interactions, and container orchestration using Docker and Docker Compose. The purpose of these projects is purely experimental, focusing on testing how Docker handles various scenarios across different programming languages and technologies.

## Important Notice

	•	Not Intended for External Use: This repository is not intended for anyone else to interact with or modify. It is strictly a personal playground for testing out Docker’s capabilities in different environments.
	•	Generated Code: Much of the code in this repository was generated by ChatGPT. As such, the primary intent is to explore Docker, not to create fully functional or optimized applications.
	•	No Guarantee of Functionality: These projects were not built with the goal of working perfectly or producing finished applications. Some services may not work as expected, and functionality is not the main focus.

## Purpose

The goal of these projects is:

	•	To experiment with Docker in managing multiple services across different tech stacks.
	•	To see how Docker handles various configurations and dependencies, and explore its containerization capabilities.
	•	To test multi-service orchestration using Docker Compose.

## Why You Shouldn’t Touch This Repo

	•	Personal Use: This repository is a sandbox for Docker experimentation. It is not meant for external users to modify or run.
	•	Code is Experimental: The code is unpolished and may not be functional in many cases. It’s designed for testing Docker, not for building production applications.
	•	Incomplete Projects: Some projects might be half-finished or designed purely to see how Docker reacts to different setups.

## Technologies Explored

Some of the technologies and languages tested in this repository include:

	•	Docker
	•	Docker Compose
	•	TypeScript
	•	Go
	•	Python
	•	C++
	•	PostgreSQL

## Conclusion

This repository is a personal experiment with Docker, exploring how it manages different types of services and technologies. It’s not intended for external use or collaboration. The focus is on pushing Docker’s boundaries, not on building functional applications.

This README should make it clear to anyone who comes across the repo that it’s not for external use, and that its purpose is mainly exploratory.
